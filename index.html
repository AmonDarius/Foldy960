				<h2>A simplified and responsive 960&nbsp;grid.</h2>
					<p>We've used <a href="http://960.gs">960.gs</a> at <a href="http://paravelinc.com">Paravel</a> for so long, it made sense to modify what we knew as we made the transition over to Responsive Web Design. </p>
					<p>Foldy is not Yet-Another-Boilerplate. It a little kit built for those headed down a responsive route and have experience with the 960 grid. It's built to be modified.</p>

				<div class="grid_2" style="clear:left">
					<h3>6 is the magic number!</h3>
					<p>Foldy is a simplified 6 column grid based in spirit on the 960 grid. We also keep this as simple as possible, stripping out any prefix/suffix stuff.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="grid_2">
					<h3>Pad your content</h3>
					<p><code>.content-pad-left</code> &amp; <code>.content-pad-right</code> exist so you can add more padding to a block of content if needed.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="grid_2">
					<h3>.grid_right</h3>
					<p>Floating content right instead of left is helpful if you want that content to display first in the collapsed view. We have a class for that. <em>See cat above.</em></p>

  				<h3>.foldy-gallery</h3>
  				<p>One common task in responsive web design is making a grid of thumbs collapse into a 2-column grid. Foldy makes this easy. 6 is the magic number. And it should be easy enough to understand how the simplified grid works that you could modify it yourself.</p>
