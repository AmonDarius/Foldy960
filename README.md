# Foldy960 - A responsive 960 grid from Paravel
Foldy960 isn't aiming to be Yet-Another-CSS-Framework and we hesitate to use the term "Boilerplate".  Foldy is just a little kit and some extra classes to get you going on making your [960.gs](http://960.gs) design responsive.

Truth be told, this isn't even an official [Paravel](http://paravelinc.com) project - I'm just posting this because we said we would in an episode of the ATX Web Show http://atxwebshow.com/2011/05/13/episode-29-responsive-web-design/

## Features
* Simplified 3 Column Responding Grid
  * `< 400px`: One column fixed
  * `401px-640px`: One column fluid.
  * `641px-960px`: Fluid grid
  * `> 960px`: Fixed width 960 grid
* `.grid_right` for proper content collapsing
* `.content-pad-right` & `.content-pad-left` for extra padding if you needed. Obviously, not the most desired semantics, but absolutely bulletproof when you're padding content.
